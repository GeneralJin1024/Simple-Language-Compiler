I implemented the parser in the object-oriented way: put the data and the 
code together. Constructing a separate class for each non-terminal X. An instance of X represents a parse tree node.
General Methods in a class including:
parse(), print(), exec()

A Parser class is responsible for static members like Scanners for code and data files.
A Memory class simulates the function stack of the entire program. The main program is treated as a function named "program"
Invoking functions and manipulating variables needs to go through the Memory class(i.e. calling the static method inside the Memory class)
The Func class stores the formal parameters in its scope, a pointer to its method body(except the "program" function) and the arguments being passed into it(once invoked)
The instance of Id class has methods to get its name, value and also assign its value.
